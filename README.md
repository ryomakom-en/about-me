# Ryoma Komiyama — Data Journalist
I am a data journalist at **The Asahi Shimbun**, specializing in data-driven investigations on **elections, public health, and climate risk**. My work combines large-scale data cleaning, causal inference, geospatial analysis, and interactive visualization — always with fully reproducible R workflows. I collaborate closely with academic researchers and specialist reporters to ensure that analyses are rigorous and grounded in real-world context.

## 📌 Featured Investigations

### **1. How Japan’s First Major Populist Party Found Its Voters**
A 10-wave political-attitude survey (5,200 people; 19,000 responses) revealed how a centrist party’s supporters moved to a new right-leaning populist party — a shift large enough to reshape Japan’s party system.  
**Skills:** quasi-panel survey analysis, Sankey visualization, R, Flourish

### **2. Japan’s True COVID Toll: 135,000 Excess Deaths in Three Years**
Geospatial analysis showed that rural prefectures — not major urban areas — experienced the highest per-capita mortality during the pandemic. This project quantified the gap between official COVID deaths and actual all-cause mortality.  
**Skills:** excess mortality modeling, mapping (sf), R

### **3. Why Japan’s Coolest Regions Face Double the Heatstroke Risk**
Analysis of **790,000 emergency heatstroke transports (2008–2022)** showed that residents in Japan’s coolest northern prefectures face nearly **2× the risk** of residents in warmer areas at the same temperature.  
**Skills:** climate–health modeling, nonlinear regression (GAMs), interactive graphics

### **4. How a Religious Organization Delivered Decisive Votes in a National Election**
A quasi-experimental design comparing matched municipalities showed that support from a controversial religious organization delivered ~17,000 votes — enough to flip a national-level proportional race.  
**Skills:** causal inference (matching), election data, uncertainty estimation
